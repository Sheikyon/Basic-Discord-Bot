# Windows 10/11 and Office Activator written in VBScript

This Windows activator, written in VBScript, is served by invoking system-level commands that replicate [massgrave.dev](https://massgrave.dev/)’s activation mechanisms, such as injecting generic KMS keys and emulating a local Key Management Service to bypass Microsoft’s licensing verification for Windows, while for Office, it adapts by targeting the Office Software Protection Platform with similar KMS emulation or the Ohook method to modify licensing DLLs, ensuring both systems register as fully activated without genuine product keys.

This script just makes the command execution faster. It's not malware, and you can see it by checking the code, which is less than 200 bytes.
